- ğŸ‘‹ Yo, Iâ€™m Q0LT (like Colt, but with more flair)
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m into tech, denim, and making farms cool again
- ğŸ¤  Currently knee-deep in penetration testing (and no, itâ€™s not as sexy as it sounds)
- âš¡ Fun fact: My horse Chance is like a cyberpunk stallionâ€”fast, smart, and slightly rebellious
